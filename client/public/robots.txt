# Crawl-delay can be tuned if your server cannot handle burst crawls
# Crawl-delay: 10

# IMPORTANT: The Sitemap directive must use an absolute URL (including scheme and
# hostname). Replace the placeholder below with your production URL before
# deploying (for example: Sitemap: https://your-domain.com/sitemap.xml).
# Relative paths like "/sitemap.xml" are not valid here and will trigger
# "Invalid sitemap URL" errors in crawler validators.
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
